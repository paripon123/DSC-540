### Final Project (Airbnb data analysis)

#### Abstract
The goal in this paper is to classify and predict availability of the listing room specifically in
New York City areas including all five neighborhoods which may potentially help travelers
finding the right area to rent on Airbnb. In this research, multiple machine learning
algorithms are applied including decision tree (QUILAN, J.R. (1986)), random forest
(Breiman, L.,2001) and boosting for both regression and classification to compare results.
Wrapper feature selection is also applied throughout the research to find the best set of the
model. As a result, both regression and classification show low accuracy around 30% and
high error which I conclude that this approach and method I used, may not bring up the
suitable model to predict or classify accurately.
#### Introduction
 - Background 
###
In the hospitality world, advance technology company like Airbnb has played an impactful
role to make it easy for travelers to explore the world. Airbnb has connected people around
the world through their platform which help people access to local areas. Since it was
founded in San Francisco in 2008, it has rapidly growth the community with now over 500
million guests arrivals all-time and over 7 million and listing room worldwide in over 191
countries (Airbnb, 2019). Travelers have selected Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities
and opportunities to experience the more unique and personalized way of vacation or trip.
Furthermore, since the technology is an important part to people especially young people
who eager to travel, Airbnb is disrupted the hospitality world which it takes a huge part of the
market share from the leader in this hotel business in the past years.
The pricing and location are the most intriguing that make people abandon their safety and
convenience living in hotel and seek to connect with strangers. However, Airbnb still has a
huge problem that the rate of host cancelling reservation at the last minute is rising and also
the safety problem and poorly property management which sometimes led to tragic (New
York Times). Yet, it is still irresistible by some specific location and style that make it a huge
different even if it may come with risk.
 - Objective
###
Since New York city is one of the biggest cities in the world, the problem of listing
availability seems not to be reliable. For example, some host have never updated their
number of availabilities of their renting property or those number are made up. Moreover, the
knowledge of the area that sometimes cause traveler a problem.
In this paper, the dataset is about host, geographical availability and metrics number in New
York City which is represented from Airbnb within 2019. As for the prediction and analysis
through the process, machine learning algorithms are applied to this dataset to try to learn
about the trend of traveler using Airbnb from the past year and try to learn from the travelerâ€™s
review and rating to evaluate which areas in New York city have the busiest schedule and try
to predict the availability for room listing in certain area.
